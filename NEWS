# Text Editor 48.alpha

 * The view menu has been removed in favor of a new properties panel
   based on feedback from users over the past couple of years.
 * The indention selection menu has also been removed for the same
   reason.
 * More options in preferences have been exposed.
 * The 'grid' option has been removed from preferences as it has had
   a number of issues. Though if you've enabled it, it will continue
   to be visible to allow turning it off.
 * Opening files with encoding errors will present the option to select
   an encoding from the infobar.
 * Text Editor now uses the new "text" GtkFileDialog APIs from GTK.
   This should allow using portals and thus, Nautilus as a file chooser.
 * Document statistics can be updated as you type in the new panel.
 * The language selection dialog shows recent languages above other
   languages to make common changes quicker.
 * The position label is now displayed above the editor view when the
   cursor moves for reasons other than typing such as jumping by arrow
   movement or mouse/touch press to move the cursor.
 * Fix alignment/sizing of zoom buttons.
 * A new fullscreen mode similar to Ptyxis/Epiphany.
