# Text Editor 42.0

GNOME Text Editor 42.0 is here, as our debut release for GNOME.

We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed to make this happen which is
impossible to name directly because so much has had to improve across the stack
to make this possible.

We hope you enjoy Text Editor and find it a pleasing experience.

# Text Editor 42.rc1

This is our first release candidate for GNOME 42. With luck, this will be our
last release before 42.0. At this point, we consider the project code complete
until we branch and begin the GNOME 43 cycle.

That doesn't mean there are not bugs or things we want to be different, simply
that time is here to ship a product.  We hope you enjoy it and responsibly file
bugs and/or additional design requests.

I'd like to send a special thanks to all the translators who've been working to
land translations in time for 42, despite the state of the world and the
struggles involved.

Changes since 42.beta1

 • CSS styling tweaks.
 • The enchant spellcheck backend will now ignore dictionaries which
   fail to provide a name which can be displayed to the user. This so far
   has only been seen on macOS but may affect other platforms.
 • Updated application metadata and screenshots.
 • Translation updates.

# Text Editor 42.beta1

This is our first Beta release as we progress towards GNOME 42. A number
of bug fixes have landed since 42.alpha2 and we encourage your further
testing to make 42 a great reveal!

 • Many CSS integration improvements including recoloring
 • Text Editor will now locate style schemes in additional search paths
 • Fixes to search bar positioning and focus-in state
 • You can now tweak many per-document settings using the context menu
   within the page which can help users determine what settings were/are
   global from the view menu vs how they were overriden by automatic
   settings discovery (which can be disabled in preferences).
 • Smart-Home-End behavior is now enabled in "before" mode
 • New command line options have been added
 • Build fixes for macOS
 • We now advertise the GTK version we require propertly for line-height
 • Improvements to titles/subtitles to reflect various document capabilities
 • A new style scheme has been added for printing which is used automatically
   until we have further settings in GtkPrintOperation via Flatpak portals.
 • More strict checks in B+Tree code for spell checking. If you find any
   assertions, please do tell us!
 • Propertly use AdwApplication base class
 • Improvements to failure paths when access to underlying GFile or GFileInfo
   fails to provide reasonable information.
 • Spellcheck settings are now persisted across sessions using extended
   attributes.
 • The buffer monitor is now disabled when a buffer fails to load
 • The default style scheme is now set to Adwaita propertly
 • Search now draws various bubbles around the matches to make them easier
   to differentiate from the background text.
 • Translation updates

# Text Editor 42.alpha2

This is our second Alpha release as we progress towards GNOME 42. Please take
some time and test the application and submit bug reports. Distributions are
encouraged to package GNOME Text Editor so that we can fix any lingering
integration issues before the Beta releases.

 • Mnemonics for the primary menu have be updated to reduce duplicates.
 • Restoring windows from the session now uses `gtk_window_set_default_size()`
   and `gtk_window_get_default_size()` to improve the chances we get the
   proper size restored. There may still be issues on Xorg with GTK 4, but
   that needs to be addressed in GTK 4.
 • Paths are now properly expanded/collapsed for `wordexp()` when directories
   with spaces are used.
 • A new document properties dialog has been added to get information about
   the document such as number of words, characters, and lines.
 • Regex search from the search bar works again.
 • Spellchecking will now use the `def:misspelled-word` style from the
   GtkSourceStyleScheme when available, allowing schemes to override styling.
 • Fix the default style scheme to be Adwaita in gsettings.
 • You can now navigate and select style schemes with the keyboard in
   the Preferences dialog.
 • Always show the current style scheme in Preferences.
 • Style schemes in Preferences are now sorted in lexicographic form along
   with the presence of an alternate light/dark style. This should result in
   similar placement of schemes across application changes to light/dark.

 • Track monospace-font-name from desktop preferences.
 • Improve recoloring for some style schemes with metadata overrides.
 • Various macOS build and runtime fixes.

 • Improve printing support for various fonts, sizing, margins, and more.
 • Prune discard drafts when cleaning up session.
 • CSS fixes for integrating with libadwaita and GtkSourceView.
 • Various Vim emulation improvements.
 • Text Editor will now prefer "python3" over "python2" when a documents
   content-type matches `text/x-python`, as that is overwhelmingly what
   is found in files today.
 • When windows are restored, they will no longer restore empty drafts, even
   if they were modified previously (added text then undo/deleted).
 • The about dialog show now include proper git commit hashes for development
   builds (`meson configure -Ddevelopment=true`) to aid in users and
   distributions submitting helpful bug reports.
 • Translation updates.
