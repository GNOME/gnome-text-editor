# Contributing

We welcome contributions of all types!

## Code of Conduct

The Text Editor project is governed by the
[https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct](GNOME Code of Conduct)
and contributors are expected to adhere to that.

## Design First

The Text Editor project focuses on design before code. If you'd like to add new
features to Text Editor, coordinate with the GNOME Design Team to work on
mockups and think through how the feature will affect other features. Often
times, adding a new feature can alter how we present other features.

You can find mockups for Text Editor on the GNOME Design Team's
[https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/app-mockups/-/tree/master/text-editor](text editor mockups)
repository.

## Coding Style

Text Editor follows the GTK coding style which is similar to the GNU style.
