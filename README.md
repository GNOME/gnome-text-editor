# Text Editor

Text Editor is a simple text editor that focus on session management.  It works
hard to keep track of changes and state even if you quit the application. You
can come back to your work even if you've never saved it to a file.

## Dependencies

Text Editor was built for the upcoming GTK 4 and GtkSourceView 5.  However, it
has since been backported to GTK 3 and GtkSourceView 4 to make it more easily
consumable until those have been released.

## Plans

Everyone has their favorite programming text editors. Text Editor is focused
on being a great default text editor.
