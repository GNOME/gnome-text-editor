# GNOME Text Editor

GNOME Text Editor is a simple text editor that focus on session management.
It works hard to keep track of changes and state even if you quit the
application. You can come back to your work even if you've never saved it
to a file.

## Dependencies

GNOME Text Editor is built on the upcoming GTK 4 and GtkSourceView 5.
It is current a test playground for these refreshed technologies.

## Future Plans

Everyone has their favorite programming text editors. Instead, GNOME Text Editor
is completely focused on being a great default text editor.
