  <title>Undoing, redoing, and discarding changes</title>

  <p>
    GNOME Text Editor automatically keeps track of changes made while editing 
    a file.
    Changes can be undone and redone while editing, making it easy to fix
    mistakes.
  </p>

  <note style="important">
    <p>
      Changes tracked for a file will be lost after closing it, or after
      <link xref="#discard_changes">discarding changes</link>.

      <keyseq>
        <key>Ctrl</key>
        <key>Z</key>
      </keyseq>
      will undo the last change made to a file.
      Using this shortcut repeatedly will continue undoing changes as they 
      were originally made.

        <key>Shift</key>
        <key>Z</key>
      </keyseq>
      will redo the last undone change in a file.
      Using this shortcut repeatedly will continue redoing changes as they were

    <note style="important">
      <p>
        Changes can be redone <em>only</em> if the previous editing operation 
        was undo or redo.
        For example, typing text into a file directly after undoing a change 
        will prevent redoing the last undone change.
