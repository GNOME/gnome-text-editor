  <title>Draft folder</title>

  <p>GNOME Text Editor will automatically save every unsaved file. This folder
  is located in the application data directory (~/.local/share/gnome-text-editor or
  in the respective flatpak folder). You should normally not care about that folder
  as every draft file is always accessible via the <gui>Open</gui> menu.</p>

  <p>You can identify a draft in the title of GNOME Text Editor. There is a subtitle
  'Draft' if your current document is not saved and will reside in the draft folder.</p>
